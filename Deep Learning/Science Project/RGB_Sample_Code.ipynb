    "## Project Summary\n",
    "The total economic benefits of global ecosystem services such as pollination and water purification are estimated to be $125 trillion USD per year[1]. Hence, with the rapid biodiversity decline around the globe[2], the efforts to understand and protect our invaluable ecosystem is needed now more than ever. Additionally, the use of capture-recapture - among other traditional methods for ecological research and conservation - can be extremely costly and labour-intensive[3], hence demanding for their automation. An improvement in ecological research techniques is especially needed when the resources for such efforts are often limited[4].\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the advancement in drone technology, hyperspectral imaging and artificial intelligence may allow for a cost-effective automation of the scat detection and collection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the feasibility of such an idea, around 2000 spectral readings were collected. The data was then used to test the ability of hyperspectral imaging, in combination with a neural network, to differentiate the reflectance spectra of scat samples, in comparison to those of other non-scat elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results showed a significant improvement in the average prediction accuracy when hyperspectral data were used instead of RGB data (z-score of 4.45). Hence, the result signifies the potential of hyperspectral drones to identify scat samples in the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "By collaborating with researchers or organisations with hyperspectral drones, field tests may be carried out in the future to validate the drones’ abilities to automate the detection and collection of these ecological samples.\n",

    "A neural network is a computational tool that has to ability to easily learn complex patterns from a large quantity of data for applications such as classification and feature imitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network consists of input nodes and subsequent nodes that sum the value of nodes before it, with each node value multiplied by a scalar. Initially, the scalar values are randomly assigned. But a partial derivative can determine the influence of each node on the final output. The values of the scalars are then updated based on the influence/partial-derivative values and the sizes of the classification errors. Over time, this gradient descent process would improve the classification accuracy. With sufficient training data, neural networks can then be used to identify scat samples in the wild based on their reflectance spectra.[33]\n",

    "## Structuring the networks\n",
    "#### 7. The 1st layer of the hyperspectral network\n",
    "For the hyperspectral data set, an additional layer was added to the start of the network topology to reduce the data’s complexity. Traditionally, the first hidden layer looks for simpler features, in this case, the individual absorption features.[34] Looking for correlation at an individual wavelength level, however, requires much computational cost. But as the absorption features exist as clusters of neighbouring wavelengths, we can use a convolution network like approach to convey the sequential and incremental relationship of wavelength inputs. The prioritization of relationships among neighbouring inputs would reduce the computational cost. This convolution network like structures was, however, built from scratch, by stacking smaller dense layers together. This was to avoid the spatial invariance, whose generalisation in absorption features characteristics would disregard their potential variance across the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For image classification, a neural network should be able to recognise the same features or objects regardless of location. For example, the classification network should be able to recognise an orange regardless of its position on an image, whether it be at the top corner, the bottom corner or anywhere else. The use of the same image feature extraction process regardless of location is called translational invariance.[34]\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, absorption features in hyperspectral reflectance data may vary in characteristics in a different location of the spectrum. The shape of an absorption feature in the infrared region of the spectrum may differ from the one in the visible region. Hence, the convolutional-like neural network is customised to remove the translational invariance feature. Different feature extraction processes would then be trained for interpreting absorption features from a different region of the spectrum.\n",

    "<img src=\"../Image/Invariance.jpg\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",

    "A leaky RELU (Rectified linear unit) was also used in both networks as the activation function. This ensured the required non-linearity for problem-solving without the high computational cost of functions like softmax. It also prevented the exploding gradient in backpropagation that is associated with the conventional RELU. "
